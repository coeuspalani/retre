# retre
Retre is a web platform designed to bridge the gap between machine learning project creators and users who want to test and utilize those projects. Built with a robust Django backend and a responsive frontend, Retre allows creators to upload multiple ML models and associated files (like model weights, encoders, scalers) under their profiles.
